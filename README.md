# World Population Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing population statistics of countries across various decades. The analysis is performed using Python with the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. The project also includes visual insights derived from a secondary dataset, `ice_cream_ratings.csv`, to demonstrate plotting and visualization techniques.

---

## Dataset(s)

1. **Primary Dataset**: `world_population.csv`
   - **Rows**: 234 countries/territories
   - **Columns**: 17 fields including population metrics from 1970 to 2022, area, density, growth rate, and continent-wise classification.

2. **Secondary Dataset** *(for visualization examples only)*: `ice_cream_ratings.csv`
   - Daily synthetic ratings for flavor, texture, and overall quality.

## Libraries Used

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

## Key Steps in Analysis

### 1. Data Loading and Formatting

* Loaded the dataset using `pd.read_csv`.
* Applied `pd.set_option` for float formatting.
* Normalized column names using `.str.replace()` and `.str.lower()`.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics

* Used `df.describe()` to extract central tendencies and spread.
* Checked for missing values via `df.isnull().sum()`.
* Validated uniqueness across all relevant fields with `df.nunique()`.

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Renamed all columns to snake\_case for consistency and readability.

### 4. Sorting and Grouping

* Sorted data based on `2022_population` to identify top populous nations.
* Performed continent-wise grouping and mean aggregations for population trends across decades.

### 5. Correlation Analysis

* Computed correlations on numerical features only using `df.corr(numeric_only=True)`.
* Visualized with a Seaborn heatmap.

### 6. Outlier Detection

* Boxplots were used to visualize and identify outliers across the dataset.

## Visualizations

### Population Data (World)

* **Heatmap of Correlations**: Reveals relationships between population metrics and derived fields such as density and growth.
* **Boxplots**: Outlier detection on numerical data.
* **Trend Analysis by Continent**: Population growth by continent from 1970 to 2022.
* **Line Plot**: Population trends across decades per continent.

### Ice Cream Ratings

* **Line Chart**: Subplots for each rating metric over time.
* **Bar & Horizontal Bar Charts**: Flavor, texture, and overall rating comparisons.
* **Pie Chart**: Percentage composition of flavor ratings.
* **Scatter Plot**: Flavor vs. Overall rating.
* **Histogram**: Frequency distribution of ratings.
* **Area Plot**: Visual area representation of daily ratings.

## Notebooks & Scripts

* Main notebook: `world_population_analysis.ipynb`
* Optional visualization notebook: `ice_cream_ratings_plotting.ipynb`

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* numpy

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Place `world_population.csv` and `ice_cream_ratings.csv` in the root directory.
3. Run the notebooks to generate visual insights.

## Notes

* All visualizations use built-in Pandas/Matplotlib/Seaborn methods.
* Project focuses on data quality inspection, transformation, and EDA.
* No machine learning models are applied; this is purely statistical + visual exploration.
